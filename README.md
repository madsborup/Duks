## Vision

The room above seems like a messy place, but you can also tell that it's a place for work. Tools ready to grab, shelves for materials, whiteboards to write notes and ideas, and functional furniture. Similar to this, Duks aims to be a digital space with tools to express ideas and manage materials (media) in collaboration with others.


## Current version
Right now Duks is just a simple project management tool. It supports:

### Projects and boards

Create projects, invite people and see project tasks on boards

### Flows

Create flows (groups of tasks)

### Tasks

Create tasks: assign them to different people, add comments and manage their state


## Stack and tools

- React
- Redux
- TypeScript
- styled-components

Firebase for authentication and database.

Built with create-react-app.
