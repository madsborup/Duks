# Vision

The room above seems like a messy place, but you can also tell that it's a place for work. Tools ready to grab, shelves for materials, whiteboards to write notes and ideas, and functional furniture. Similar to this, Duks aims to be a digital space with tools to express ideas and manage materials (media) in collaboration with others.


# Current version
Right now Duks is just a simple project management tool. It supports:

- Create/edit projects and flows
- Create/edit tasks: assign them to different people, add comments and manage their state
- Invite people

# Stack and tools

Duks is built with the following tools and technologies:

- React
- Redux
- TypeScript
- styled-components

Firebase for authentication and database.

Built with create-react-app.
